# 🏀 NBA Prediction Algorithm
Taking my passions for Basketball, Sports Analytics, and Programming and combining them with the goal of understanding what makes an NBA team good? What makes a player affective? And what metrics are best used when determining player success?

The goal of this project is to gather all the data and ultimately provide a UI that basketball fans can work with to answer questions about their favourite players/teams or compare how good players/teams were in different eras.
